The first ceremony of Halloween is pulling each a \u201cstock,\u201d or plant of kail. They must go out, hand in hand, with eyes shut, and pull the first they meet with: its being big or little, straight or crooked, is prophetic of the size and shape of the grand object of all their spells-the husband or wife. If any \u201cyird,\u201d or earth, stick to the root, that is \u201ctocher,\u201d or fortune; and the taste of the \u201ccustock,\u201d that is, the heart of the stem, is indicative of the natural temper and disposition. Lastly, the stems, or, to give them their ordinary appellation, the \u201crunts,\u201d are placed somewhere above the head of the door; and the Christian names of the people whom chance brings into the house are, according to the priority of placing the \u201crunts,\u201d the names in question.\u2014R.

When the corn is in a doubtful state, by being too green or wet, the stack-builder, by means of old timber, etc., makes a large apartment in his stack, with an opening in the side which is fairest exposed to the wind: this he calls a \u201cfause-house.\u201d\u2014R.

Whoever would, with success, try this spell, must strictly observe these directions: Steal out, all alone, to the kiln, and darkling, throw into the \u201cpot\u201d a clue of blue yarn; wind it in a new clue off the old one; and, toward the latter end, something will hold the thread: demand, \u201cWha hauds?\u201d i. e., who holds? and answer will be returned from the kiln-pot, by naming the Christian and surname of your future spouse.\u2014R. B. [back]", "Note 10. Take a candle and go alone to a looking-glass; eat an apple before it, and some traditions say you should comb your hair all the time; the face of your conjungal companion, to be, will be seen in the glass, as if peeping over your shoulder.\u2014R.

Others omit the harrowing, and say: \u201cCome after me and harrow thee.\u201d\u2014R. B. [back]", "Note 12. This charm must likewise be performed unperceived and alone. You go to the barn, and open both doors, taking them off the hinges, if possible; for there is danger that the being about to appear may shut the doors, and do you some mischief. Then take that instrument used in winnowing the corn, which in our country dialect we call a \u201cwecht,\u201d and go through all the attitudes of letting down corn against the wind. Repeat it three times, and the third time an apparition will pass through the barn, in at the windy door and out at the other, having both the figure in question, and the appearance or retinue, marking the employment or station in life.\u2014R.

Take three dishes, put clean water in one, foul water in another, and leave the third empty; blindfold a person and lead him to the hearth where the dishes are ranged; he (or she) dips the left hand; if by chance in the clean water, the future (husband or) wife will come to the bar of matrimony a maid; if in the foul, a widow; if in the empty dish, it foretells, with equal certainty, no marriage at all.
