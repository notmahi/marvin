Ever looked into a robot’s eyes and thought what would happen if it could understand my emotions and respond in kind? Neither have we. But this is what would happen if they did.

Looking into our robot’s eyes triggers a call to microsoft’s Azure Emotion API, which sends a picture of the person’s face and receives a score that describes the emotional state of the person divided into percentages of anger, contempt, disgust, fear, happiness, neutral, sadness, and surprise. Based on this emotional score, our software will choose an appropriate poem to print out of its mouth via a thermal printer (the same kind used for receipts). The robot serves mostly as a human interface that conveniently hides the ugly insides. This project will consist both of making the robot and of writing the software. If we have time, we’ll also add an LED display for any messages that the robot may wish to impart.
